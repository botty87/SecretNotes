A simple Android notes manager, where you can easily save your note with, or without, a password. Your secret notes are security encrypted and your sensible data (credit card, bank details) are protected, otherwise you can also save a not sensible data in a normal note.
The notes could be local or synched through Firebase.

All the project is in Kotlin

You can share and use the code, but please, at least, let me know. Especially if for commercial use.
