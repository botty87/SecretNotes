A simple notes manager, where you can easily save your note with, or without, a password. Your secret notes are security encrypted and your sensible data (credit card, bank details) are protected, otherwise you can also save a not sensible data in a normal note.

The notes could be local or synched through Firebase.

You can share and use the code, but please, at least, let me know. Especially if for commercial use.
